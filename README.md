# Assemble Game - React

This project is part of my journey through the [Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/). Scrimba has been a big part of helping me transition into frontend development, and this repo reflects one of the many challenges I've worked on during the course.

## About the Project

Assemble Game is a React-based project designed to help solidify my understanding of state management, component composition, and interactivity in React. It’s one of several challenges from the course that focuses on applying what I've learned in a practical way. The goal is to create a functional and engaging small app while getting more comfortable with React fundamentals.

### Features:
- Functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Dynamic rendering of content based on user interactions
- Component-based architecture

## What I Learned

This project pushed me to:
- **Manage state effectively**: I had to think about where state should live and how to pass data between components without making things messy.
- **Think in components**: Breaking down the UI into reusable and manageable pieces has been a key part of learning React.
- **Handle interactivity**: React’s reactivity made it easier to update the UI, but I had to plan carefully to make sure things updated as expected.

## Scrimba Career Path Challenges

The challenges in this course are designed to help build confidence by doing, rather than just watching tutorials. For me, this hands-on approach has been great for understanding not just the "how" but also the "why" behind the code.

### Other Takeaways from the Course
- A stronger understanding of JavaScript basics (a work in progress for me!).
- Writing cleaner, more modular CSS.
- Learning how to debug more effectively.
